# PteroClient

#### A Fabric-Mod for interacting with your Pterodactyl-Panel.

### NOTE: This is kind of a Proof-of-Concept at the moment. It doesn't have much functionality yet, but there's much to come in the future.

#### What can it do?
- It can list any existing servers connected to a specific panel-user.
- It can show Basic Stats for those Servers (currently the Server Ip and CPU/Memory/Storage-Usage).
- It can create Simple Servers, where you can Specific Name, User, Memory, Storage, Egg, and the Startup-Command for the Server. (Currently, the creation of Servers won't show any visual note. The Console tho will say `Successfully created Server.` when done.)

If you have ideas of things to add, contact me on Discord instead of crying about it: `Chloe ‚ù§#6666` (copy/paste the name. Discord apparently has this username too often, so i had to use some random something behind it ._.)
